\title{Calculate Quadratic Roots for Confidence Intervals}
\usage{
GetCIvals(CIcoef)
}
\arguments{
\item{CIcoef}{Numeric vector of length 3. The coefficients \eqn{(a, b, c)} of the quadratic
inequality, typically obtained from \code{\link{GetCIcoef}}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 2 containing the two roots.
}
\description{
Computes the roots of the quadratic equation \eqn{a\beta^2 + b\beta + c = 0}.
These roots serve as the boundaries for the confidence sets constructed by inverting
the UJIVE/LIML score test.
}
\details{
This function applies the standard quadratic formula:
\deqn{\beta_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}}

\strong{Warning:} This function does not check the sign of the discriminant. It is intended
to be called by a wrapper function (like \code{\link{GetCItypebd}}) that first verifies
the existence of real roots (i.e., \eqn{b^2 - 4ac \ge 0}).

Depending on the sign of \eqn{a} (convexity), these values represent either the endpoints
of a bounded confidence interval or the inner boundaries of a disjoint ("donut") confidence set.

\title{Classify and Compute Confidence Interval Bounds}
\usage{
GetCItypebd(CIcoef)
}
\arguments{
\item{CIcoef}{Numeric vector of length 3. The coefficients \eqn{(a, b, c)} obtained
from \code{\link{GetCIcoef}}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 3: \code{c(CItype, LowerBound, UpperBound)}.
}
\description{
Solves the quadratic inequality \eqn{a\beta^2 + b\beta + c \leq 0} derived from the
score test inversion to determine the topology and boundaries of the confidence set
for \eqn{\beta}.
}
\details{
The confidence set is defined as \eqn{\{ \beta : a\beta^2 + b\beta + c \leq 0 \}}.
Depending on the sign of \eqn{a} and the discriminant \eqn{\Delta = b^2 - 4ac},
this set can take one of four forms (Dufour, 1997):

\describe{
\item{\strong{Type 1: Bounded Interval (Standard)}}
{\eqn{a \ge 0, \Delta \ge 0}. The parabola opens upward. The CI is the closed interval between the roots.}

\item{\strong{Type 2: Disjoint Union (Weak Identification)}}
{\eqn{a < 0, \Delta \ge 0}. The parabola opens downward. The CI is the union of two infinite rays:
\eqn{(-\infty, \text{Lower}] \cup [\text{Upper}, \infty)}. This is often referred to as a "donut" interval.}

\item{\strong{Type 3: Real Line (No Identification)}}
{\eqn{a < 0, \Delta < 0}. The parabola is always negative. The CI includes the entire real line.
Bounds are returned as \code{c(-100, 100)} placeholders.}

\item{\strong{Type 4: Empty Set (Misspecification)}}
{\eqn{a \ge 0, \Delta < 0}. The parabola is always positive. The confidence set is empty,
implying the model is rejected at the specified significance level for all \eqn{\beta}.}

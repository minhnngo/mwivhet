\arguments{
\item{CIcoef}{Numeric vector of length 3. The coefficients \eqn{(a, b, c)} obtained
from \code{\link{GetCIcoef}}.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of length 3. Format: \code{c(CItype, LowerBound, UpperBound)}.
}
\description{
Solves the quadratic inequality \eqn{a\beta^2 + b\beta + c \leq 0} derived from the
score test inversion to determine the topology and boundaries of the confidence set
for \eqn{\beta}.
}
\details{
The confidence set is defined as \eqn{\{ \beta : a\beta^2 + b\beta + c \leq 0 \}}.
Depending on the sign of \eqn{a} and the discriminant \eqn{\Delta = b^2 - 4ac},
this set can take one of four forms:

\itemize{
\item \strong{Type 1: Bounded Interval} (\eqn{a \ge 0, \Delta \ge 0}).
The parabola opens upward with real roots. The CI is the closed interval \eqn{[\beta_{min}, \beta_{max}]}.

\item \strong{Type 2: Disjoint Union (Donut)} (\eqn{a < 0, \Delta \ge 0}).
The parabola opens downward with real roots. The CI is the union of two infinite rays:
\eqn{(-\infty, \beta_{min}] \cup [\beta_{max}, \infty)}.

\item \strong{Type 3: Real Line} (\eqn{a < 0, \Delta < 0}).
The parabola is always negative. The CI includes the entire real line.
Bounds are returned as placeholders \code{c(-100, 100)}.

\item \strong{Type 4: Empty Set} (\eqn{a \ge 0, \Delta < 0}).
The parabola is always positive. The confidence set is empty, implying the model
is rejected at the specified significance level for all \eqn{\beta}.

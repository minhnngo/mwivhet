\title{Compute UJIVE Signal Component (Stratified Design)}
\usage{
GetLM(df, X, e, groupW, group, noisy = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame. Contains the observable variables and grouping indicators.}

\item{X}{Column name (unquoted). The first variable (e.g., endogenous regressor).}

\item{e}{Column name (unquoted). The second variable (e.g., outcome or residual).}

\item{groupW}{Column name (unquoted). The covariate stratification variable (defines blocks).}

\item{group}{Column name (unquoted). The instrument grouping variable (defines treatments).}

\item{noisy}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints progress of the stratum iteration.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Numeric scalar. The sum of stratum-specific quadratic forms.
}
\description{
Calculates the UJIVE "signal" or cross-product term \eqn{X' G e} for a design where
instruments are nested within discrete covariate strata (e.g., Judges within Years).
This function iterates through covariate groups to compute the quadratic form locally,
handling the centering of instruments within each block.
}
\details{
This function implements the estimator for the signal component \eqn{S} in a stratified design:
\deqn{S = \sum_{s} e_s' [ U(P_{Q,s}) - U(P_{W,s}) ] X_s}

Within each stratum \eqn{s}:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{P_{Q,s}} is the projection onto the instrument groups.
\item \eqn{P_{W,s}} is the projection onto the stratum intercept (local mean).
\item \eqn{U(P)} denotes the projection with diagonal elements removed and inverse-diagonal rescaling.
}

This corresponds to the numerator terms (\eqn{P_{XY}, P_{XX}}) for test inversion in
designs with discrete controls.

  groupQ,

\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame. Contains the observable variables and grouping indicators.}

\item{groupW}{Column name (unquoted). The covariate stratification variable.}

\item{groupQ}{Column name (unquoted). The instrument grouping variable.}

\item{X}{Column name (unquoted). The endogenous regressor.}

\item{Y}{Column name (unquoted). The outcome variable.}

\item{MX}{Column name (unquoted). Leverage-adjusted regressor (\eqn{M X}).}

\item{MY}{Column name (unquoted). Leverage-adjusted outcome (\eqn{M Y}).}

\item{q}{Numeric scalar. The critical value for test inversion (typically \eqn{1.96^2}).
Defaults to \code{qnorm(.975)^2}.}

\item{noisy}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints progress.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of length 3 containing \code{c(a, b, c)}.
}
\description{
Calculates the coefficients \eqn{(a, b, c)} for the confidence interval quadratic inequality
in a general design that includes both grouping (stratification) and covariates.
This function is optimized for designs where projection matrices are block-diagonal
with respect to \code{groupW} but potentially asymmetric within blocks due to covariate adjustments.
}
\details{
This function performs a loop:
\enumerate{
\item Splits data by \code{groupW}. Computes local projection matrices
\eqn{P_Q} and \eqn{P_W} for each stratum.
\item Calculates the full UJIVE weighting matrix \eqn{G = U(P_Q) - U(P_W)} locally.
Since \eqn{G} is asymmetric, it computes all 5 variance components.
\item Accumulates all polynomial coefficients for \eqn{\hat{V}(\beta)}
simultaneously using extensive pre-calculation of vector products.

\title{Compute UJIVE Signal Component (No Covariates)}
\usage{
GetLM_nocov(df, X, e, groupZ, noisy = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame. Contains the observable variables and grouping indicator.}

\item{X}{Name of the first variable column (unquoted), typically the endogenous regressor.}

\item{e}{Name of the second variable column (unquoted), typically the outcome or residual.}

\item{groupZ}{Name of the instrument grouping variable (unquoted).}

\item{noisy}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints progress of the group iteration.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar representing the total sum of group-specific quadratic forms.
}
\description{
Calculates the UJIVE "signal" or cross-product term \eqn{X' G e} for the "Many Means" design.
This function exploits the block-diagonal structure of the projection matrix implied by
mutually exclusive instrument groups to compute the quadratic form via efficient group-wise summation.
}
\details{
This function computes the scalar:
\deqn{S = \sum_{g=1}^J e_g' [ (I-D_{P_g})^{-1}(P_g - D_{P_g}) ] X_g}
where \eqn{P_g} is the projection matrix onto the intercept for group \eqn{g} (i.e., the group mean).

This calculation corresponds to the numerator components (\eqn{P_{XY}, P_{XX}}) of the
score statistic variance estimator in designs without covariates.

\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame. Contains the observable variables \eqn{X, Y} and their projections.}

\item{P}{Matrix. The full projection matrix \eqn{P}.}

\item{G}{Matrix. The UJIVE weighting matrix \eqn{G}.}

\item{X}{Name of the endogenous regressor column (unquoted).}

\item{Y}{Name of the outcome variable column (unquoted).}

\item{MX}{Name of the column (unquoted) containing \eqn{M X} (leverage-adjusted regressor).}

\item{MY}{Name of the column (unquoted) containing \eqn{M Y} (leverage-adjusted outcome).}

\item{Z}{Matrix. The instrument matrix.}

\item{W}{Matrix. The covariate matrix.}

\item{q}{Numeric. The critical value for the test inversion (typically \eqn{1.96^2}).}

\item{noisy}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints progress during variance component calculation.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 3 containing \code{c(a, b, c)}.
}
\description{
Calculates the coefficients \eqn{(a, b, c)} of the quadratic inequality \eqn{a\beta^2 + b\beta + c \leq 0}
used to construct confidence intervals for \eqn{\beta} in general instrumental variable designs.
This function supports asymmetric weighting matrices (e.g., UJIVE with continuous covariates)
by using the fully generalized \code{_iloop} variance estimators.
}
\details{
This is the most general version of the confidence interval coefficient calculator.
It does not assume symmetry of the weighting matrix \eqn{G}. Consequently, it computes
all five distinct variance components (\eqn{A_1} through \eqn{A_5}) for each term in the
polynomial expansion of \eqn{\hat{V}(\beta)}.

The function explicitly constructs the diagonal adjustments for the UJIVE signal calculation
using the matrices \eqn{Z} and \eqn{W}.

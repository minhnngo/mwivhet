\title{Compute Quadratic Coefficients for CI (No Covariates)}
\usage{
GetCIcoef_nocov(df, groupZ, X, Y, MX, MY, q = qnorm(0.975)^2, noisy = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame. Contains the observable variables \eqn{X, Y} and their projections.}

\item{groupZ}{Name of the instrument grouping variable (unquoted).}

\item{X}{Name of the endogenous regressor column (unquoted).}

\item{Y}{Name of the outcome variable column (unquoted).}

\item{MX}{Name of the column (unquoted) containing \eqn{M X} (leverage-adjusted regressor).}

\item{MY}{Name of the column (unquoted) containing \eqn{M Y} (leverage-adjusted outcome).}

\item{q}{Numeric. The critical value for the test inversion (typically \eqn{1.96^2}).}

\item{noisy}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints progress during variance component calculation.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 3 containing \code{c(a, b, c)}.
}
\description{
Calculates the coefficients \eqn{(a, b, c)} of the quadratic inequality \eqn{a\beta^2 + b\beta + c \leq 0}
used to construct confidence intervals for \eqn{\beta} in the "Many Means" setting (no covariates).
This function inverts the UJIVE/LIML score test using optimized variance estimators for
block-diagonal designs.
}
\details{
This function performs the same logic as \code{\link{GetCIcoef}} but is specifically
appropriate for designs where instruments form mutually exclusive groups
and no global covariates link them.

The returned coefficients define the confidence set:
\deqn{\{ \beta : (P_{XX}^2 - q C_2)\beta^2 + (-2 P_{XY} P_{XX} - q C_1)\beta + (P_{XY}^2 - q C_0) \leq 0 \}}

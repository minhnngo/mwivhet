\title{mwivhet: Inference with Many Weak Instruments and Heterogeneity}
\description{
Calculate test statistics and confidence intervals in a linear instrumental variables model with possibly many weak instruments and heterogeneous treatment effects, using methods developed in Yap (2025) \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11193}. Implements a novel score statistic and a leave-three-out variance estimator that is asymptotically uniformly most powerful unbiased. Also computes Lagrange Multiplier tests for robust inference in the presence of high-dimensional covariates.

Description: Calculate test statistics and confidence intervals in a linear
    instrumental variables model with possibly many weak instruments and
    heterogeneous treatment effects, using methods developed in
    Yap (2025) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11193>. Implements a novel score
    statistic and a leave-three-out variance estimator that is asymptotically
    uniformly most powerful unbiased. Also computes Lagrange Multiplier tests for
    robust inference in the presence of high-dimensional covariates.
